Registers:
	r0 --> 0(rp)
	...
	r15 --> 15(rp)
	rp = sp - 1
	gonna do (rp + register)then rp - register

	Specific cases:
		 sp - 0x00ffffff
Program Counter:
	mov	WARM(wpc), r0
	increment wpc and r15(rp)

Condition Bits:
	  clear and copy from wind
All 
    Condition codes - check before
    	      mask then goto place where do the checking
	      need to determine if gonna set them - ?
The Arithmetic Format
    Look for 0 @ 27
    Mask opcode, dest, src, src right
    Jump based on opcode

    Imeddiate mode
    	      look for 0 @ 14
	      need value then shift by exponent
